# Big-Data-Indexing and Application Techniques for Insurance Claims

> Developed a big data design prototype REST API for insurance claims in Flask-Python3. 
> A json-shcema is passed through curl commands using either Postman or command prompt. The data is stored in Redis.

> Through this you can add update, delete, merge attributes to the same object or array without invalidating schema and implementation of ETags and REST API Security

> Integrated Elasticsearch and demonstrated basic searches using Kibana.
